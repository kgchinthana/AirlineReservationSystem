# DBMS (CS3043) - MiniProject

## Basic Idea

Here we have designed a airline reservatiion system for an imaginary airline company to manage flights and flight reservations.
We try to add two UIs,<br> 
1. for users to book flights and see flight details
2. for admin section to see reservaion details and flight details<br>

We are trying to build this without using any pre-built libraries and frameworks.

**You will need to use XAMPP server to run and see this code.**

## Project Structure

### mySQL database

we added 11 tables to work out whole system.

1. aircraft - here we keep details about all planes 
2. aircraft_model - using this table to track seat capasity of each plane
3. airport - details about each airports where the company manages flghts
4. class_price - there are three classes according to the services company supply, choosing higher tier class will add a price raise to the base price of the flight
5. flight - details about scheduled upcoming flights by the company
6. flgiht_detail - detail about flights planned between each aiport and plane using for them
7. base_price - base price for each flight, depends on distance and also plane using for the journey
8. reservation - details about reservations done by users
9. seat - class and plane of each seat belongs
10. user - details about registered users
11. user_type - user types (gold, frequent, guest) and their speacial discounts
